<strong>Harrison Ford Dealership</strong>

<p>
This is a personal project for <strong>Codefi's</strong> Code Lab's One. This project currently encompasses the Rails I course by Pragmatic Studios. One exception is that this does not yet contain a one-to-many association. However in harrison_ford_ii, there are many-to-many and through associations.

<p>
This is a fake care dealership that utilizes names of Star Wars characters and popular Harrison Ford movie roles. It was just for fun and I claim no rights to it. :)
